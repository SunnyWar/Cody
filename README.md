Cody: The AI-Authored Chess Engine
Cody is an experimental chess engine where every single line of code is generated by Artificial Intelligence. The goal of this project is to push the boundaries of LLM-assisted programming and answer one question: How strong of a chess engine can an AI build from scratch?

🚀 The Philosophy
Unlike traditional engines (like Stockfish) or even NNUE-based engines tuned by humans, Cody is a "Zero-Human-Code" project.

Architecture & Logic: All search algorithms, evaluation functions, and bitboard manipulations are AI-generated.

Debugging: Human intervention is limited to providing error logs back to the AI for self-correction.

Goal: To achieve a competitive ELO rating while maintaining a codebase entirely birthed from prompt engineering.

🛠 Features (Current Status)
Bitboard Representation: High-performance board state management.

UCI Protocol Support: Compatible with standard chess GUIs like Arena, Cute Chess, or Scid vs. PC.

Search Algorithms: * Negamax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Iterative Deepening.

Quiescence Search to avoid the "horizon effect."

Evaluation: Hand-crafted AI heuristics including Piece-Square Tables (PST) and material imbalance weights.

How it works.
Currently a local script is run. This script instructs an AI to find a change to the code. It is run as a scheduled task.
1. install openai
pip install openai

2. run script whenever you want to update Cody
python .\cody-agent\agent.py
