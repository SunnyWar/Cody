# Cody: The AI-Authored Chess Engine

![Cody icon](chesscat256.ico)

Cody is an experimental chess engine where every line of code is generated by AI. The goal is to push LLM-assisted programming and answer one question: how strong of a chess engine can AI build from scratch?

## 🚀 Philosophy

Unlike traditional engines (like Stockfish) or NNUE-based engines tuned by humans, Cody is a "Zero-Human-Code" project.

- **Architecture and logic:** All search algorithms, evaluation functions, and bitboard manipulations are AI-generated.
- **Debugging:** Human intervention is limited to providing error logs back to the AI for self-correction.
- **Goal:** Achieve a competitive ELO rating with a codebase birthed from prompt engineering.

## 🛠 Features (Current Status)

- **Bitboard representation:** High-performance board state management.
- **UCI protocol support:** Works with standard chess GUIs like Arena, Cute Chess, or Scid vs. PC.
- **Search algorithms:**
  - Negamax with alpha-beta pruning.
  - Iterative deepening.
  - Quiescence search to avoid the horizon effect.
- **Evaluation:** AI-crafted heuristics, including piece-square tables (PST) and material imbalance weights.

## 🧠 How Cody Learns

Cody uses a simple loop when the agent attempts a code improvement:

1. **Read:** Load Rust files to provide context.
2. **Propose:** The LLM suggests a fix and returns a unified diff.
3. **Apply:** The diff is applied to disk.
4. **Verify:** Run `cargo clippy`, then `cargo build`, then `cargo test`.
5. **Rollback:** If build or tests fail, the last diff is reverted.

## 🧪 Orchestrator Setup (LangGraph)

Install LangGraph (and the OpenAI client):

```powershell
pip install -U langgraph openai
```

Authenticate with OpenAI:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
```

Configure the orchestrator in `cody-agent/config.json`:

```json
{
   "branch_prefix": "ai-feature-",
   "model": "gpt-5.1",
   "models": {
      "refactoring": "gpt-5.1",
      "features": "gpt-5.1",
      "logic_bugs": "o3",
      "clippy": "gpt-5-mini",
      "unit_tests_docs": "gpt-5-nano"
   },
   "use_local": false,
   "skills": {
      "enabled": ["github_fix_ci", "github_address_comments"],
      "run_timing": "after",
      "ci_log_path": ".orchestrator_logs/ci_failure.txt",
      "pr_comments_path": ".orchestrator_logs/pr_review_comments.json"
   }
}
```

## ▶️ Run the Graph Agent

From the repo root:

```powershell
python .\cody-graph\main.py
```

Optional environment overrides:

```powershell
$env:CODY_REPO_PATH = "D:\Cody"
$env:CODY_CONFIG_PATH = "D:\Cody\cody-agent\config.json"
```
